How to upload a local directory tree with source code files to GitHub.com
=========================================================================
  
First of all, identify yourself to your local git installation

   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Show all settings and their respective origins

   git config --list --show-origin

Assuming there is an account on GitHub.com

1) Log in to GitHub.com and create an empty repository
2) Clone the repo on your local machine 
   
   git clone https://github.com/jke1968/<repoName>

3) copy all files from local directory into newly created directoy <repoName>
4) cd into <repoName>
5) create a .gitignore file including patterns for all files and folders that should not be uploaded
6) create a snapshot of all the files in <repoName>

   git add .

7) and commit all changes

   git commit -m "commit message"

8) now push all changed and new files onto GitHub.com

   git push origin main

 
How to check if a local repository is up to date
================================================

1) Update the remote-tracking branches without changing the local branches

   git fetch origin

2) Determine differences between local and remote branch (behind, ahead, diverged)
 
   git status

3) if desired, update local branch to remote branch

   git pull origin

   -> all changes in the remote repository since the last local commit have now been applied to the local repository
